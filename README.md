This function calculates the L1 sensitivity, which is the maximum possible absolute difference between the two arrays. Then it uses the sensitivity measure divided by the epsilon value to calculate the scale parameter for the exponential mechanism. After that, it samples a value from a discrete probability distribution over a range of possible values, where the probability of each value is determined by the exponential mechanism. Finally, it adds additive Gaussian noise to the result with a scaling factor that depends on the Gaussian distortion protection (delta). This scaling factor allows to control the trade-off between privacy and accuracy.

The privacy budget, represented by the epsilon value, determines the level of privacy, while the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise, represented by the sigma value, and the Gaussian distortion protection, represented by the delta value, determine the level of noise added to the result.

It is important to note that the choice of the differential privacy definition, the sensitivity measure, and the noise distribution can vary depending
